Hi, I’m @UnregisteredGuest 
I’m interested in server administration, Linux application development, and network security. And fudge.

Currently, I only know Python, but in the future I'd love to learn Rust for more low level stuff. 

Why is there nothing on my GitHub profile? Because I have no ideas. Maybe a GTK GUI for pmbootstrap?
