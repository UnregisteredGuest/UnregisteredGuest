Hi, I’m @UnregisteredGuest 
I’m interested in server administration, Linux application development, and network security. And fudge.

Currently, I only know Python, HTML/CSS, and a bit of C.

Why is there nothing on my GitHub profile? Because I have no ideas. Maybe a GTK GUI for pmbootstrap? Probably the code for the photography website I want to make eventually...
